# Snippetbox / Let's Go

Working through the Let's Go book by Alex Edwards.

https://lets-go.alexedwards.net/

I've messed around with the Gin framework for making go apis and was talking to some people on reddit that convinced me you don't need a framework, just use the std lib. Then they told me about Alex's blog (which is great) https://www.alexedwards.net/blog

So I figured I would check out his books.

"Let's Go" reminds me a lot of the "Flask Book" by Miguel Grinberg : https://flaskbook.com/. Which is a must read for anyone in the python Web App / API space.
